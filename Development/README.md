# Development Stage
The items in this folder are for local development of a LAMP based project. 

## Overview

This vagrant file will spin up a box that has everything you need for LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) development. 
I use this with WordPress, but it can be used for HTML/Static site development as well. 

The MySQL credentials for adminer (and the database) are: 

username: vagrant
password: password

adminer (to manipulate the MySQL database can be found at: 
http://localhost/adminer/adminer.php
